Python program to reset AD user password based on telephone number 

This is part of a project I am doing for a client to reset the password for a user in their Microsoft Active Directory. 

In case a user's password has expired, he has the option to dial a phone number which takes him through an IVR menu
where the user is validated using a TPIN, and triggers this program which will reset his password.

The new password will then be sent via SMS to the user
